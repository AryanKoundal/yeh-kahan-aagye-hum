# include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    float r= 3;
    float pi= 3.14;
    printf("area of circle is %f\n",pi*r*r);
    float h=3;
    printf("vol of the cylinder is %f",pi*r*r*h);
    return 0;
}
//either you can put formula in the statement or make its own variable ie 
//area=pi*r*r in this case.both will work
